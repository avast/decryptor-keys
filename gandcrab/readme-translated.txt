GandCrab for help SY people.

For antiviruses:
Decryptor to develop independently for each version.
We believe in the "power" of Bitdefender, since they all promise the decryptor constantly, and it is not yet ready, but now it is being developed and will soon be ready. Without keys, true. We would very much like the decryptor to be written by Kaspersky or Eset.
The most important thing is not to indicate that he will help everyone. He will help only a citizen of Syria. Because of their political situation, economic and relations with the CIS countries.
We regret that we did not initially add this country to the exceptions. But at least that way we can help them now.
Whose keys are not (only for citizens of Syria and the CIS, Ukraine including) - you need to come to us and take a picture of yourself with a passport and payment page. After that, we will issue a decryptor for free.
This is indicated just in case any clever people patch the file so that it works everywhere. Hi, Polish kurvy.
As for other countries - we will not share the keys, even if we are closed someday. We will remove them. It is necessary to resume the punitive process in respect of some countries.
Let me remind you that you can only decrypt using our keys that are stored on our server. We issue them only after payment. There are no other miracle ways.

With love from crabs, representatives of different countries, religions, beliefs and beliefs.
